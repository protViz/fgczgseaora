# Unsupervised Clustering and Cluster Profiling of Label Free Quantification experiments


What cluster profiling is. It is clustering of the proteins from a Protein Quantification experiment and afterwards running ORA analysis 
for each generated cluster. 
It can be run 
At the Functional Genomics Center Settings we run LFQ epxeriments. There existis an automated processing pipeline.

Is cluster profiling possible in .

What are the scientific insights.

Cluster Profile ORA analysis for a clustering result.
What are 8-100, mostly 4 replication conditon, 2-16 conditions.
Does it make since.


Method:


Conclusion:
Technical, if results are biologically meaningfull, What we can learn.
